This repository is the official implementation of **Agent 0**.

![](./figs/fig1.png)

**Agent0** is a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents from scratch without relying on any human-curated data. It employs a symbiotic competition between a **Curriculum Agent** (proposing tasks) and an **Executor Agent** (solving tasks with tools), driving a self-reinforcing cycle of improvement.

## 🔥 Key Features
* **Zero Data:** Eliminates dependency on external data or human annotations.
* **Co-Evolution:** Establishes a competition where the curriculum agent creates increasingly difficult tasks and the executor agent learns to solve them.
* **Tool Integration:** Integrates external tools (e.g., code interpreter) to enhance problem-solving and pressure the curriculum agent to generate complex, tool-aware tasks.

## 📊 Results
Empirically, Agent 0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities on the Qwen3-8B-Base model:
* **+18%** improvement on Mathematical Reasoning benchmarks.
* **+24%** improvement on General Reasoning benchmarks.

## 🚀 Code
**Coming soon.**
